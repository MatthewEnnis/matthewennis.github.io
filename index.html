			<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
			<h4>Twitter Bot / Web Crawler</h4>
			<p>Wrote a web crawler in Python which searches Irish Rail's website to find delays on specific trains, then tweets the day’s total delays and what percentage of those delays were acknowledged by Irish Rail. Can be found on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/IgnoredDelays">@IgnoredDelays</a> and eventually led to Irish Rail changing how they report delays</p>
